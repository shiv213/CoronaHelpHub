In USA almost 20% of elderly people are in active work group and living pay check to pay check; while they are at high risk group but don't have option to stay home and be safe and considering this is such a severe problem; It's our responsibility as a citizen to help elderly or other vulnerable member of society by providing them physical and moral support. e.g. Help them ordering food. Help them ordering grocery, bring their grocery etc.

Many organizations and individuals are willing to help but don't have the infrastructure ready to support volunteer work. Our platform is one where individuals can find and offer volunteer services.
